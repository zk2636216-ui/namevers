  {
    q: 'What are nature baby names?',
    a: 'Nature names are drawn from the natural world \u2014 plants, trees, flowers, weather, landscapes, seasons and celestial bodies. They range from long-established names such as Rose, Hazel and Iris to modern choices such as Wren, Juniper and Atlas.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are nature names suitable for boys and girls?',
    a: 'Many are used across genders. Botanical names skew toward girls in current US usage, while landscape and celestial names skew toward boys, but the split is not fixed and several names \u2014 Rowan, Sage, River, Wren \u2014 are genuinely neutral.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do nature names have meanings beyond the obvious?',
    a: 'Often, yes. Many plant and tree names carry symbolic associations that predate their use as names, and several have separate documented meanings in different traditions. Our profiles record the meaning we hold for each name rather than assuming the literal plant name is the whole story.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which nature names are rising fastest?',
    a: 'Short, soft botanical names and celestial names have moved fastest \u2014 Wren, Juniper, Nova, Luna, Aurora. Longer botanical names such as Magnolia and Camellia remain comparatively rare, which makes them the better choice if you want a nature name that is not already common.',

          Choosing a nature name
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            Nature names have an unusual property: their literal meaning is visible to everyone. That
            makes them easy to explain and hard to hide. A child named Juniper will be asked about the
            tree; a child named Atlas will be asked about the myth. Neither is a problem, but it is a
            different experience from a name whose meaning is buried in etymology.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second thing to weigh is how crowded the group has become. Botanical and celestial names
            have moved into the mainstream quickly, and several of the most attractive options are now
            common. If rarity matters, the productive zone is the longer botanical names and the less
            familiar constellations \u2014 Magnolia, Camellia, Zinnia, Corvus, Aquila.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, check the name&rsquo;s documented meaning rather than assuming it. Several nature
            names carry a traditional meaning that differs from the literal reading, and a few have
            distinct meanings in different traditions. Our{' '}
