const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'What is a gender-neutral baby name?',
    a: 'A gender-neutral name is one that is given to boys and girls in meaningful numbers, rather than being strongly associated with one. Some names are neutral by origin, others become neutral over time as usage shifts \u2014 which is why neutrality is a moving property rather than a fixed category.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do gender-neutral names stay neutral?',
    a: 'Not always. Names often drift toward one gender once they become popular for that gender, and a name that is balanced today can be strongly one-sided a decade later. Checking current usage rather than relying on a name\u2019s reputation is the only reliable approach.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are unisex names a modern invention?',
    a: 'No. Many names now treated as neutral have centuries of use behind them, and in several traditions names were never gender-marked in the first place. What is modern is the deliberate choice of a neutral name, not the names themselves.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How many gender-neutral names does NameVerse list?',
    a: 'Our database records several hundred names as unisex across the four traditions we cover. The selection on this page shows the best-documented of them; the full set is available through the names directory filtered by unisex usage.',

          How names drift between genders
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            Gender association is not a property a name has; it is a pattern in how people use it, and
            patterns move. A name can be evenly split for a generation and then tip decisively one way
            once it becomes fashionable for that gender. The reverse happens too, though less often.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters practically. If you choose a neutral name because you want it to stay neutral,
            the useful question is not &ldquo;is this name unisex?&rdquo; but &ldquo;which direction is
            its usage moving?&rdquo; A name that is 60/40 today and drifting is a different choice from
            one that has held near 50/50 for decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second thing worth knowing is that neutrality is cultural, not universal. A name that is
            firmly one gender in one language can be neutral in another, and families naming across two
            traditions often find that the same name reads differently in each. Our{' '}
