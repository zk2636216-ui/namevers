const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'What are vintage baby names?',
    a: 'Vintage names are names that were common in earlier generations, fell out of fashion, and are now being used again. The clearest examples are names that peaked in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century and had become rare by the 1990s \u2014 Eleanor, Theodore, Mabel, Walter, Hazel, Arthur.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why are vintage names popular again?',
    a: 'Two reasons. First, they are recognisable without being crowded: a name that was common a century ago is familiar to everyone but rare in a modern classroom. Second, they carry a sense of continuity, which matters to parents choosing a name with family or cultural weight.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are vintage names the same as classic names?',
    a: 'Not quite. A classic name has been in continuous use \u2014 Elizabeth, James, William. A vintage name went away and came back. The distinction matters because vintage names are still climbing, so a name that feels rare today may be considerably more common in ten years.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which vintage names are rising fastest?',
    a: 'The strongest revivals tend to be names with a soft sound and a clear literary or historical association. Names ending in a vowel or a soft consonant \u2014 Eloise, Theodore, Matilda, Silas \u2014 have moved fastest, while harder-edged Victorian names such as Percival and Archibald remain genuinely rare.',

          Why vintage names return
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            Naming fashion runs in roughly century-long cycles. A name that was everywhere in 1900
            becomes unfashionable by 1950, feels dated by 1980, and by 2020 has lost its association
            with any living generation. At that point it stops sounding old and starts sounding
            distinctive \u2014 which is exactly when it comes back.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mechanism is generational rather than aesthetic. A name is only &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo;
            while the people who bore it are still around to be associated with it. Once that
            association fades, what is left is the name&rsquo;s sound and its meaning, and many of these
            names have both in abundance.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a practical consequence worth knowing. Because vintage names are still climbing,
            the ones that feel rare today are the ones with the strongest associations \u2014 the harder
            Victorian names, the ones tied to a specific historical figure. The soft, vowel-ending
            revivals are already well into the mainstream, and our{' '}
