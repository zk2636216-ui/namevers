  {
    q: 'What are the shortest baby names?',
    a: 'The shortest usable names are three letters \u2014 Kai, Leo, Max, Eli, Ivy, Ava, Mia, Zoe. Two-letter names exist but are rare in English-speaking countries. Three-letter names are the practical floor for a name that will not be constantly misspelled.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why are short baby names so popular?',
    a: 'They are easy to spell, easy to pronounce across languages, and they fit well with long surnames. They also tend to be unisex, which makes them flexible. The current US top 10 is dominated by one and two syllable names for exactly these reasons.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do short names have less meaning?',
    a: 'No. Length and meaning are unrelated. Many short names carry substantial documented meanings, and several are contractions of longer traditional names \u2014 Eli from Elijah, Leo from Leonidas, Mia from Maria. Our profiles record the meaning we hold for each.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are short names good for bilingual families?',
    a: 'Often, yes. Short names with simple phonetics tend to survive translation better than long ones, because there is less to adapt. Names built from sounds that exist in both languages \u2014 Kai, Leo, Mia, Zoe \u2014 usually need no adjustment at all.',

          Why short names are winning
        </h2>
        <div className="prose-nv mt-4 max-w-3xl">
          <p>
            The current US top 10 is almost entirely one and two syllable names, and the reason is
            practical rather than aesthetic. A short name is faster to say, easier to spell, and less
            likely to be shortened by other people into something you did not choose. It also survives
            translation better, which matters in a country where a large share of families name across
            two languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a second effect worth knowing about. Short names are more likely to be unisex,
            because a name with fewer phonetic markers carries less gender information. That makes the
            short-name list a productive place to look if you want a neutral name \u2014 Kai, Ari, Noa,
            Remi, Wren and Sage all sit in both categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trade-off is crowding. Because short names are popular, the best-known ones are common.
            If you want a short name that is not already everywhere, the productive zone is the less
            familiar three-letter names and the short forms of longer traditional names \u2014 Cleo, Juno,
            Rhea, Zora, Ira, Gus. Our{' '}
